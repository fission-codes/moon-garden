### Amazing

I think a lot about "declarative" vs "imperative" recently.
We could represent the filesystem declaratively or we could do imperative changes on it.
Why not say "make sure there's a file with this content" instead of saying "make this file have this content".
Or why not say "I want these files in this directory", instead of saying "remove this, add this, etc.".

The thing is, you don't want the **whole filesystem** in memory at once.

So you won't be able to say "I want this exact state of the filesystem", you need a way to say "I don't care about these files, but I want this to be the structure in the filesystem apart from that".

Or maybe you need a way to handle whole subtrees/files as an identity. Saying "whatever was at `Documents/Test.md`, I now want at `Documents/Notes/Test.md`". Or "whatever was at `public/Apps/Published/a` I now want at `public/Apps/Published/b`".

---

I get that it's weird. At the end-user level we're doing *imperative changes*. "Add some text here, change the title there, check some checkmark here."
Should we convert that into a declarative view of data? And then convert that back into changes?
It all seems so weird.
But at the same time, we like to write code that depends on the current state of the system, not on changes.
So either, we have to implement our algorithms given some changes, or we have to convert our deltas into a concrete state.
